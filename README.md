- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jefry1217
- 👀 I’m interested in (i'll update this later).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can to do with programming, I know that I really enjoy it but not sure what aspect of programming I want to go into yet, so am currently just learning heaps and trying as many things as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically any projects that I can work on, I'm a new programmer but if you want a programmer buddy to work on something with, let me know, just trying to learn as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me (i'll update this later).
